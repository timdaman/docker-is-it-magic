I use this repository to introduce people to the underpinning of Docker. 

Docker takes advantage of a lot of technologies in the kernel that people are often unaware of. This can lead to a lot of confusion and makes it hard to embrace Docker a it looks like magic. My hopes is that this content show off those technologies and thus makes it easier for people to get comfortable and efficient with Docker.

I have not made many efforts to lay these files out in user friendly manner, this mostly operates as notes to myself. That being said if you want clone the repo you will want to do a recursive clone like so


    git clone --recursive  https://github.com/timdaman/docker-is-it-magic.git
